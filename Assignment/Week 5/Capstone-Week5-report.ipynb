    "While getting the latitudes and longtitudes of the neighbourhoods, the data was collected via Google Map instead of querying the geocoder via code because the geocoder was not available and could not return any results. So the data was gathered by checking on Google Map manually since there are only 6 neighbourhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we looped through each neighbourhood and query the Foursquare to get popular venues nearby. The venues were then turned into one-hot encoding and normalized to be clustered by k-means.\n",
    "\n",
    "With k-means clustering, the neighbourhoods were clustered into 3 clusters and finally the clustering was displayed on the folium map."

    "The result with the clustering quite makes sense to local people staying in Singapore because among the 6 neighbourhoods, the 4 neighbourhoods in the same cluster are more similar to each other because they are residential areas. The other 2 neighbourhoods, Changi Bay and Paya Lebar are clustered in 2 groups on its own because these two areas have some special usage. Changi Bay has ferry station and Paya Lebar has military base. So they are clustered into seperate groups by their own. \n",
